# Square-Based Maze Generator
- Create a solvable graph representation of a 2D-maze with 90Ëš branches.
- Ensure abstract model of the maze would fit within 2D space.
- Allow buckling-back (or cycles) in the maze
- Find the (shortest) solution of a given maze from a graph representation.
- Generate less or more branches of greater or lesser depths when first making the maze.
