# Square-Based Maze Generator
- Create a solvable maze-graph object representation of a 2D-maze with 90Ëš branches.
	- Ensure abstract model of the maze would fit within 2D space.
	- Allow buckling-back (or cycles) in the maze.
	- Generate less or more branches of greater or lesser depths when first making the maze.
- Find the *top 3* shortest paths from start to finish on a maze-graph object.
- Validate that the maze-graph model fits within 3D space.
- Analyze maze difficulty based on number and depth of branches, twists, etc
