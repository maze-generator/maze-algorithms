## Description
My current project is a maze-generator CLI written in Python.
I hope to port the Python code into TypeScript &amp; React.js.
I want to make this project work in the browser, so that recruiters can interact with it better.


## Objective: Display on the Browser
Doing my research, I noticed that there are few maze generators of quality on the internet.
I think that this project could potentially bring a number of users.

To do so, I must use a hosting service to make my project go live.

## Objective: Use TypeScript &amp; React.js
The current project is written in Python.
However, I think this project will be more effective if ported to TypeScript &amp; React.js.

Because this is using TypeScript, my code should have little code smell.
Once complete, the customized linter should have no issues with my code.

## Objective: Render an `.svg` or `.png`
Currently my project visualizes a maze as a text file.
Rendering it as an image instead will help user experience.

## Evaluation
You must meet the following criteria in order to pass the intensive:
- Students must get proposal approved before starting the project to pass
