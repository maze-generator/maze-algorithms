/***********************************************************
This section describes footnotes & comments for the project.
These should mostly contain bugs and todo items.

== TODO ==
Maze array should have a fixed size:
size = maze length Ã— maze height

== TODO ==
Maze class only supports 2D-Square mazes.
Add support for ND-polyhedral mazes.

== TODO ==
Maze class only supports breadth-first traversal.
Add support for other maze-generation algorithms.
